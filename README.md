# NOTICE OF DISCLAIMER
The Software are provided AS IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF FUCTIONING at your own platform. This R&D code was crafted to run locally on LANL's Darwin HPC platform, and modfications are expected when this code being mitigated to other platforms/environments. 


# Getting started and use the code
-Clone this repository to your local machine using your tool of choice. The setup.sh script was used to set up environment on LANL Darwin.
-Insall needed packages, includking such as cuda, miniconda, and others, if they are missing.
-Using command "sbath jobs/train.sh' to submit model training jobs. Modfications of parameters in train.sh may be necessary for different models. This step can take a long time for training.
-Using command "sbath jobs/val.sh' to submit model validation and test jobs.
-Model outputs are save to the ckpt subfolder. Several existing models are saved in the same place. 
-Input and target data files are found inside the dataset subfolder.
